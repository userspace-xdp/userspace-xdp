# test framework

We have machine octopus1 and octopus3

```txt
+--------+      +--------+
|octopus1|------|octopus3|
| Pktgen |------|   NFs  |
+--------+      +--------+
```

The traffic is generated by pktgen on octopus1 and received by NFs on octopus3. The NFs are running on octopus3, forwards the packets back to octopus1.

The reuslts are measured by the received packets on octopus1.

The controler script is also running on octopus2, use ssh to control the pktgen and get the data from octopus1.
