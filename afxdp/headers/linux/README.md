# NOTICE

This directory contains include header files **copied from the Linux
kernel tree**.  Some of them have been modified to ease compiling BPF
programs.

Linux distributions usually have a 'kernel-headers' software package
that also contain these files.  As BPF is in rapid development the
distro version of these header files might not be new enough to
contain the features needed by this git repo.

Thus, we maintain a copy of these header files to match the features
used by our software.
